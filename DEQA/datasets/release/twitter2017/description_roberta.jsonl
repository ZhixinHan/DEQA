The title at the top reads \"Every Harry Potter Movie Summarized In Terrible Microsoft Paint Drawings.\"\n\nOn the left side, there are two characters. The one on the left is labeled \"yer a wizard haare,\" a misspelled version of the famous line \"You're a wizard, Harry.\" This character is drawn with glasses, a simple black robe, and a lightning bolt on his forehead, which are iconic features of Harry Potter. The character on the right is much larger, with wild hair and a beard, wearing a brown coat, and is labeled \"no hagered,\" a misspelling of \"Hagrid,\" another character from the series. The dialogue between them is a humorous take on the scene where Hagrid tells Harry he is a wizard, with the Harry character responding with a simple expletive.\n\nOn the right side, there are two characters facing each other. The one on the left is wearing glasses and a black robe, similar to the Harry character on the left side, and says \"omg haare u r like slyterin grandkid or somethin,\" a misspelled and simplified version of the revelation that Harry could have been in Slytherin House due to his connection with Voldemort. The character on the right, presumably representing Harry again, responds with \"no?\" and the character on the left concludes with \"yes u r haare,\" followed by the same expletive as before.\n\nThe image is a playful and irreverent take on the Harry Potter movies, using misspellings and crude drawings for comedic effect.

{"image_name": "O_3952.jpg", "description": "This image appears to be an infographic or illustration that is critical of how Donald Trump managed charity money. The title \"On the Green\" suggests a play on words, referring both to the golfing term and the concept of money. The illustration depicts a flow of money starting with outside donors giving to the Donald J. Trump Foundation, represented by a group of people with bags of money directed towards a caricature of Donald Trump standing next to a building labeled as the foundation.\n\nThe text on the image alleges that in 2009, outside donors gave $1.1 million to the foundation, and although Trump did not contribute his own money, he distributed the funds as if they were his own. Another claim is that in 2010, Trump gave $100,000 to his son's charity with the explicit intent of offsetting costs for its annual golf fundraiser and demanded that the nonprofit Eric Trump Foundation pay his for-profit business for the event.\n\nThe illustration also shows money flowing from the foundation to a caricature of Eric Trump, who is standing next to a golf course, and then to a building representing a Trump-owned property, suggesting that charity money was used to pay for services at a Trump business. The bottom text states that the Eric Trump Foundation hosted its annual fundraiser at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, New York, and paid the president's company.\n\nOverall, the image is designed to convey the message that charity money was redirected into business revenue for Donald Trump's companies. The use of caricatures and the flow of money in the illustration serve to emphasize the points being made in the accompanying text."}
